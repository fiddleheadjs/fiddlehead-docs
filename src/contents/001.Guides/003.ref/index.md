# ref

_Some notes about `ref` in Fiddlehead._

### Forwarding refs

Different from React, Fiddlehead does not prevent you from using `ref` as a normal prop.
You are free to choose the name of the prop which forwards the ref.
As you pass that prop to a built-in element, it requires you to provide an instance of Ref,
which you will get by using the `createRef` function or `useRef` hook.

```jsx
import {useRef} from 'fiddlehead';

function TextInput({ref}) {
  return (
    <input ref={ref}/>
  );
}

function App() {
  let inputRef = useRef(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Input element', inputRef.current);
  }, []);

  return (
    <TextInput ref={inputRef}/>
  );
}
```
