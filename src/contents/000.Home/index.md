Fiddlehead is a UI library that allows you to develop web apps in the declarative style,
component-based - these make your lines of code more predictable and maintainable.

If you are familiar with React before, using Fiddlehead is quite similar.
It implements some of the main ideas of React: virtual DOM, functional components, and hooks.

Writing codes with Fiddlehead is nothing but JSX and hooks.
It is aimed to be as simple as possible, while still providing an excellent development experience.
With such criteria in mind, we made it some benefits:
- Simple usage: only JSX and hooks
- Performant: use only 50% memory, and slightly better CPU usage compared to React
- Lightweight: only 8kb (or 3kb gzipped), compared to 132kb for React
